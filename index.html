        <h2>my elevator pitch...🛗</h2>
        <p>
          I care about <strong>solving meaningful problems</strong> and
          <strong>turning ideas into real products</strong>. I've led projects
          from scratch, built and shipped products people use, and grown
          communities around them from day one. With co-op experience in
          <strong>full-stack development & product management</strong>, I'm
          exploring the intersection of
          <strong>product, engineering, and entrepreneurship</strong>.
