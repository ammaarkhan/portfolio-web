            <p>
                I'm passionate about solving meaningful problems and making a positive impact through technology. A self starter that loves collaborating! I have a strong technical background with Full Stack developer experience and proficiency in JavaScript, Python and Java. Interested in a career in product management or entrepreneurship. I'm currently building Brokol, a startup on a mission to reduce household food waste.
