        <h2>What did we do?</h2>
        <p>
          I would like to thank my friend Omar Ankit for inviting me to join his
          team. We ended up winning 1st place with our project ParkView. When
          deciding what to build, we wanted to steer away from anything related
          to social networks and focus on creating something valuable on its
          own. We brainstormed the problems we face in our daily lives and
          initially considered building an app to help students find study
          spaces on campus, as it's a nightmare during exam season.
        </p>
        <p>
          While in the library, we discussed the idea with a librarian, who
          liked it but encouraged us to tackle even bigger problems with the
          same concept. That's how we pivoted to PARKING. Our campus is known to
          be a tough place to find parking. So we decided to build ParkView, a
          parking tracker that provides real-time monitoring of parking spaces,
          integrated with a user-facing mobile app - updating the graphical map
          of the parking space in real-time.

        <h2>How we did it?</h2>
        <p>
          We used OpenCV for image processing to detect whether parking spots
          were occupied by cars through live video feed or prerecorded footage.
          We created a custom python graphical user interface (GUI) that would
          allow the user to set the parking positions, which were stored in a
          JSON file. That same JSON would be sent to our user-facing mobile app,
          built using React Native. The mobile app displayed available parking
          spots in real time with green/red boxes, updating the map as cars came
          and went.

        <h2>Ok but why?</h2>
        <p>
          The applications for ParkView are vast. We could see this being used
          in malls, airports, and any other parking lots where available spaces
          are time consuming to find. Beyond the obvious benefits of convenience
          and time-saving, this could be a game changer for people with
          disabilities who need to find the closest parking spot. Additionally,
          ParkView could be integrated into smart city infrastructures to
          monitor parking spaces and provide real-time data to city planners. It
          could help reduce traffic congestion, optimize parking management, and
          enhance urban planning.
