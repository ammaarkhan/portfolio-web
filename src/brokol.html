        <h2>Story So Far</h2>
        <p>
          Brokol (now FeedMyADHD) started with a simple idea to reduce household
          food waste. We didn't bother doing user interviews and jumped straight
          into building our visionary product (ppl compare us to the likes of
          Steve Jobs all the time). We developed an inventory tracker to help
          people track their food, get reminders when their food is about to
          expire and thus REDUCE FOOD WASTE ðŸ¤¯. The idea was an overnight
          success and we gained 5k beta installs the first week solely through
          word of mouth. People were practically throwing their money at us. lol
          just kidding - that was fun to write tho. The app never gained any
          meaningful traction and we didn't know WHO we had built the app for...
          That was our first and mighty mistake - (very) bad customer discovery.
        </p>

          Fortunately a demographic we did stumble upon in the process were
          individuals with ADHD. We found that they had a unique relationship
          with food and faced a variety of challenges. We have been exploring
          this demographic since April 2024, (doing better customer discovery)
          and are working on a new product to help them with their relationship
          with food. We're excited to see where this new direction takes us.

          We don't know yet... Maybe there's a product to be made for ADHDers,
          maybe not. We're excited to find out.
