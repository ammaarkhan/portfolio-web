        <h2>Story So Far</h2>
        <p>
          Brokol started with a simple idea to reduce household food waste. We
          didn't bother doing user interviews and jumped straight into building
          our visionary product (ppl compare us to the likes of Steve Jobs all
          the time). We developed an inventory tracker to help people track
          their food and reduce waste. The idea was an overnight success and we
          gained 5k beta installs the first week solely through word of mouth.
          People were practically throwing their money at us. lol just kidding -
          that was fun to write tho. The app never really gained any traction
          and we didn't know who our customers were... That was our first and
          mighty mistake - (very) bad customer discovery.
        </p>

          Fortunately a demographic we did stumble upon in the process was
          individuals with ADHD. We found that they had a unique relationship
          with food and faced a variety of challenges. We have been exploring
          this demographic for the past few months (doing better customer
          discovery) and are working on a new product to help them with their
          relationship with food. We're excited to see where this new direction
          takes us.

        <p>
          We don't know yet... Maybe there's a product to be made for ADHDers,
          maybe not. We're excited to find out.
